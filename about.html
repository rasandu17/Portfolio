        <p class="sub_para">I studied at Royal College Colombo and completed a foundation certificate at Informatics Institute of Technology. 
            Now, I’m doing a BSc in Computer Science at Informatics Institute of Technology, 
            which is affiliated with the University of Westminster. I’m learning web development, 
            programming languages like Java and Python, UI/UX, and designing innovative solutions. 
            I'm excited to apply my skills to create useful tech solutions.</p>
